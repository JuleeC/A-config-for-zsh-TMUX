# ZSH Config with TMUX

This project is for people who find it hard to just get a default tmux config with zsh on kitty. The config covers that kitty autostarts tmux and that the shell is being set to zsh. __REMINDER:__ the tmux autostart executes when kitty is starting and __NOT__ when zsh is starting. __WHY:__ There are probably 100 better other ways but in my opinion,this is the fastest and when booting in arch, my terminal couldnt open.
